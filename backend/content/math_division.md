# Division

## What is Division?

Division is splitting a number into equal groups or parts. It's the opposite of multiplication!

**Key Facts:**
- Division means splitting, sharing, or grouping equally
- The ÷ symbol means "divided by"
- The number being divided is the "dividend"
- The number you divide by is the "divisor"
- The answer is the "quotient"
- Division by zero is impossible!

**Two Ways to Think About Division:**

**1. Sharing (Equal Groups)**
- 12÷3 means "share 12 things among 3 people equally"
- Each person gets 4

**2. Grouping (How Many Groups)**
- 12÷3 means "how many groups of 3 can you make from 12?"
- Answer: 4 groups

**Real-World Examples:**
- 20 cookies shared among 5 friends: 20÷5=4 cookies each
- You have 24 crayons, put 6 in each box: 24÷6=4 boxes needed
- Driving 150 miles in 3 hours: 150÷3=50 miles per hour
- $36 shared equally among 4 people: $36÷4=$9 each

**Division Strategies:**
1. **Think Multiplication** - What times 3 equals 12? (12÷3=?)
2. **Repeated Subtraction** - How many 3s can you subtract from 12?
3. **Skip Counting** - Count by the divisor until you reach the dividend
4. **Using Arrays** - Draw rows and columns

**Remainders:**
Sometimes division doesn't come out even!
- 13÷4 = 3 remainder 1 (or 3 R1)
- This means 13 divided into 4 groups gives 3 in each group, with 1 left over

**Fun Fact:**
The division symbol (÷) is called an "obelus" and was invented in 1659. In some countries, people use a slash (/) or a horizontal line instead. Math symbols can be different around the world! ➗
