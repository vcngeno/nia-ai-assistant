# Understanding Fractions

## What Are Fractions?

A fraction shows part of a whole! When you eat half a pizza, you're eating a fraction of the pizza. 🍕

**Key Facts:**
- A fraction has two numbers: numerator (top) and denominator (bottom)
- The top number tells you how many parts you have
- The bottom number tells you how many equal parts make the whole
- ½ means "1 out of 2 equal parts"
- Fractions can be less than 1, equal to 1, or greater than 1

**Parts of a Fraction:**
```
  3  ← Numerator (how many pieces you have)
  —
  4  ← Denominator (total equal pieces)
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- Cutting a sandwich in half (½)
- Sharing a pizza: 8 slices, you eat 3 = ⅜ of the pizza
- Time: 30 minutes is ½ hour, 15 minutes is ¼ hour
- Money: A quarter (25¢) is ¼ of a dollar
- Sports: Your team won 3 out of 5 games = ⅗

**Common Fractions:**
- **½** = one half (like half a cookie)
- **¼** = one quarter (like 15 minutes of an hour)
- **¾** = three quarters (like 45 minutes of an hour)
- **⅓** = one third (when 3 friends share equally)
- **⅔** = two thirds

**Equivalent Fractions:**
Different fractions that represent the same amount!
- ½ = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8
- ¼ = 2/8 = 3/12
- Think of cutting a pizza into more slices - still the same amount!

**Comparing Fractions:**
- Same denominator: bigger numerator is bigger (⅗ > ⅖)
- Same numerator: smaller denominator is bigger (½ > ⅓)
- Tip: Convert to same denominator to compare easily

**Fun Fact:**
Ancient Egyptians used fractions over 4,000 years ago! But they only used fractions where the numerator was 1 (like ½, ⅓, ¼). They called these "unit fractions." To write ¾, they would write ½ + ¼! 🏺
