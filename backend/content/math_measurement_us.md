# Measurement (US Customary Units)

## How We Measure Things in America

In the United States, we use customary units like inches, feet, pounds, and gallons to measure things!

**Key Facts:**
- The US uses the customary system (also called imperial units)
- Different tools measure different things
- Always include the unit in your answer (12 inches, not just 12)
- You can convert between different units
- Most other countries use the metric system, but the US primarily uses customary

**Length (How Long or Tall):**
- **Inch (in)** - about the length of your thumb
- **Foot (ft)** - 12 inches, about the length of your foot
- **Yard (yd)** - 3 feet or 36 inches
- **Mile (mi)** - 5,280 feet, used for long distances

**Conversions:**
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 1 yard = 3 feet
- 1 mile = 1,760 yards

**Weight (How Heavy):**
- **Ounce (oz)** - a slice of bread weighs about 1 ounce
- **Pound (lb)** - 16 ounces, a loaf of bread weighs about 1 pound
- **Ton** - 2,000 pounds, about as heavy as a car

**Conversions:**
- 1 pound = 16 ounces
- 1 ton = 2,000 pounds

**Capacity (How Much Liquid):**
- **Cup (c)** - 8 fluid ounces
- **Pint (pt)** - 2 cups, a small milk carton
- **Quart (qt)** - 2 pints, a large milk carton
- **Gallon (gal)** - 4 quarts, a milk jug

**Conversions:**
- 1 pint = 2 cups
- 1 quart = 2 pints
- 1 gallon = 4 quarts

**Temperature:**
- **Fahrenheit (°F)** - used in the US
- Water freezes at 32°F
- Room temperature is about 70°F
- Water boils at 212°F
- Normal body temperature is 98.6°F

**Real-World US Examples:**
- A football field is 100 yards long
- Speed limits are in miles per hour (mph)
- The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall
- A gallon of milk weighs about 8.6 pounds
- Recipe: Add 2 cups of flour
- Temperature in New York in July: about 85°F

**Fun Fact:**
The US is one of only three countries in the world that primarily uses customary units! The other two are Myanmar and Liberia. Most scientists in the US actually use the metric system for their work! 🔬
