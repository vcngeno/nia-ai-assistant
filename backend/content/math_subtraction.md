# Subtraction

## What is Subtraction?

Subtraction is when we take away or remove numbers to find the difference. It's the opposite of addition!

**Key Facts:**
- Subtraction means taking away, removing, or finding the difference
- The minus sign (−) means "subtract" or "take away"
- The number we start with is called the "minuend"
- The number we subtract is called the "subtrahend"
- The answer is called the "difference"

**Real-World Examples:**
- You have 10 cookies and eat 3, you have 7 left (10−3=7)
- There were 15 birds on a tree, 6 flew away, 9 are still there
- You had $20 and spent $12, you have $8 left
- Your team had 8 players, 2 went home, now there are 6

**Subtraction Strategies:**
1. **Counting Back** - Start at the bigger number and count backwards
2. **Using a Number Line** - Jump backward
3. **Think Addition** - What plus 3 equals 10? (10−3=?)
4. **Making Ten** - Break numbers using groups of 10

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Always subtract the smaller number from the bigger number (unless working with negative numbers)
- Line up numbers carefully when writing vertically
- Borrow/regroup when needed (like 32−15)

**Fun Fact:**
The minus sign (−) we use today was invented in 1489 by a German mathematician named Johannes Widmann. Before that, people wrote out the word "minus" every time! ✏️
