## What is Addition?

Addition is when we put numbers together to make a bigger number! It's one of the most important math skills you'll use every day.

**Key Facts:**
- Addition means combining or putting together
- The plus sign (+) means "add" or "plus"
- The numbers we add are called "addends"
- The answer is called the "sum"
- You can add in any order and get the same answer (2+3 = 3+2)

**Real-World Examples:**
- If you have 3 apples and your friend gives you 2 more, you now have 5 apples (3+2=5)
- You read 10 pages yesterday and 15 pages today, so you read 25 pages total
- Your soccer team scored 3 goals in the first half and 2 in the second, that's 5 goals total

**Addition Strategies:**
1. **Counting Up** - Start with the bigger number and count up
2. **Using Fingers** - Great for small numbers
3. **Number Line** - Jump forward on a number line
4. **Making Ten** - Break numbers to make 10 first (7+5 = 7+3+2 = 10+2 = 12)

**Practice Tips:**
- Start with small numbers (1-10)
- Use real objects (toys, blocks, snacks)
- Practice addition facts daily
- Look for addition in everyday life

**Fun Fact:**
Ancient Egyptians were adding numbers over 5,000 years ago! They used hieroglyphics (picture symbols) to write math problems. Addition is one of the oldest math operations humans ever invented! 🔢
