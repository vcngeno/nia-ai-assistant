# Decimals

## What Are Decimals?

Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole, using place value! They're closely related to fractions.

**Key Facts:**
- Decimals use a dot (.) called a "decimal point"
- Numbers to the right of the decimal point are parts less than one
- Each place to the right is ten times smaller
- 0.5 = ½, 0.25 = ¼, 0.75 = ¾
- Money uses decimals: $3.50 means 3 dollars and 50 cents

**Place Value:**
```
Example: 4.56

4  .  5   6
↑     ↑   ↑
Ones  Tenths  Hundredths
(whole) (0.5)  (0.06)
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Money**: $5.75 (5 dollars and 75 cents)
- **Measurements**: 1.5 meters, 3.2 liters
- **Sports**: 9.8 seconds in a race
- **Grades**: 89.5% on a test
- **Temperature**: 98.6°F normal body temperature

**Reading Decimals:**
- 0.5 = "five tenths" or "zero point five"
- 0.25 = "twenty-five hundredths" or "zero point two five"
- 3.14 = "three and fourteen hundredths" or "three point one four"

**Comparing Decimals:**
1. Compare whole numbers first (3.5 vs 2.9: 3 is bigger)
2. Then compare tenths place (0.6 vs 0.4: 0.6 is bigger)
3. Then hundredths, and so on

**Adding/Subtracting Decimals:**
- Line up the decimal points!
- Add zeros if needed to make same length
```
  3.50
+ 2.75
------
  6.25
```

**Fun Fact:**
The decimal system we use today comes from ancient India and was brought to Europe by Arab mathematicians over 1,000 years ago! Before decimals, people had to use complicated fractions for everything! 🔢
