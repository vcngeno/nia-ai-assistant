# Multiplication

## What is Multiplication?

Multiplication is a fast way to add the same number many times! Instead of adding 5+5+5, we can say 3×5=15.

**Key Facts:**
- Multiplication is repeated addition
- The × symbol means "times" or "groups of"
- The numbers we multiply are called "factors"
- The answer is called the "product"
- Any number times 1 equals itself (7×1=7)
- Any number times 0 equals 0 (7×0=0)

**Understanding as Groups:**
- 4×3 means "4 groups of 3" or "3 added 4 times"
- Picture 4 baskets with 3 apples each = 12 apples total
- 5×2 means 5 pairs (like 5 pairs of shoes = 10 shoes)

**Real-World Examples:**
- Each pizza has 8 slices, you order 3 pizzas: 3×8=24 slices
- You save $5 per week for 6 weeks: 6×5=$30 saved
- A carton holds 12 eggs, you buy 4 cartons: 4×12=48 eggs
- Soccer practice is 2 hours per day, 5 days a week: 5×2=10 hours

**Multiplication Tricks:**
- **2s**: Double the number (2×6 = 6+6 = 12)
- **5s**: Count by fives or think "half of 10s"
- **9s**: The digits in the answer add up to 9 (9×3=27, 2+7=9)
- **10s**: Just add a zero! (10×4=40)
- **Commutative**: 3×4 = 4×3 (order doesn't matter!)

**Fun Fact:**
In ancient Babylon (about 4,000 years ago), students learned multiplication tables just like you do! They carved their times tables into clay tablets. Some of these tablets still exist today in museums! 🏺
