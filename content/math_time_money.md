# Time and Money

## Understanding American Time and Currency

Time and money are two super important types of math we use every single day in America!

**US Money (Currency):**

**Coins:**
- **Penny** = 1 cent (1¢) - Abraham Lincoln
- **Nickel** = 5 cents (5¢) - Thomas Jefferson  
- **Dime** = 10 cents (10¢) - Franklin D. Roosevelt
- **Quarter** = 25 cents (25¢) - George Washington

**Bills:**
- **$1** - George Washington
- **$5** - Abraham Lincoln
- **$10** - Alexander Hamilton
- **$20** - Andrew Jackson
- **$50** - Ulysses S. Grant
- **$100** - Benjamin Franklin

**Money Conversions:**
- 5 pennies = 1 nickel
- 10 pennies = 1 dime = 2 nickels
- 25 pennies = 1 quarter = 5 nickels = 2 dimes + 1 nickel
- 100 pennies = $1 = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 20 nickels

**Writing Money:**
- Use the dollar sign: $5.50
- Two decimal places for cents: $12.99
- Say: "five dollars and fifty cents" or "twelve ninety-nine"

**Telling Time:**

**Clock Basics:**
- 12 hours on a clock face
- 60 minutes in an hour
- 60 seconds in a minute
- AM = midnight to noon, PM = noon to midnight

**Reading Analog Clocks:**
- Short hand = hours
- Long hand = minutes
- Each number = 5 minutes

**Time Expressions:**
- Half past = 30 minutes after (3:30)
- Quarter past = 15 minutes after (3:15)
- Quarter to = 15 minutes before (2:45 is quarter to 3)

**Time Conversions:**
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 week = 7 days
- 1 year = 365 days (366 in leap years)

**Real-World Examples:**

**Money:**
- Buying lunch: hamburger $5.99, fries $2.50, drink $1.99 = $10.48 total
- Allowance: Save $5 per week for 4 weeks = $20
- Change: Pay $10 for $7.25 item, get $2.75 back

**Time:**
- School starts at 8:00 AM, ends at 3:00 PM = 7 hours
- Movie is 2 hours 15 minutes long
- Practice is at quarter past 4 (4:15 PM)

**Fun Facts:**
- The penny was the first US currency ever made (in 1787)!
- Benjamin Franklin is on the $100 bill, but he was never a US president
- Before 1918, every town in America could set its own time! Train schedules were impossible. Then time zones were created to organize everything 🕐
