# Word Problems

## Solving Real-Life Math Problems

Word problems help you use math in everyday situations! They're stories with numbers that need solving.

**Key Facts:**
- Word problems combine reading and math skills
- They show how math is used in real life
- Every word problem has important information (and sometimes extra info!)
- There's always a question to answer
- You need to choose the right operation (+, −, ×, ÷)

**Steps to Solve Word Problems:**

1. **Read Carefully** - Read the whole problem twice
2. **Find the Question** - What are you trying to find?
3. **Identify Key Information** - Circle or underline important numbers
4. **Choose the Operation** - Add, subtract, multiply, or divide?
5. **Solve** - Do the math
6. **Check Your Answer** - Does it make sense?

**US Examples:**

**Addition:**
"Sarah collected 15 baseball cards in June and 23 more in July. How many baseball cards does she have total?"
- Answer: 15 + 23 = 38 baseball cards

**Subtraction:**
"The Statue of Liberty is 305 feet tall. The Washington Monument is 555 feet tall. How much taller is the Washington Monument?"
- Answer: 555 − 305 = 250 feet taller

**Multiplication:**
"A movie ticket costs $12. How much will it cost for a family of 4 to go to the movies?"
- Answer: 4 × $12 = $48

**Division:**
"The school ordered 144 hamburgers for the cafeteria. They want to package them equally in 12 boxes. How many hamburgers go in each box?"
- Answer: 144 ÷ 12 = 12 hamburgers per box

**Money Problems:**
"You have $50. You buy a video game for $29.99 and a snack for $4.50. How much money do you have left?"
- Answer: $50 − $29.99 − $4.50 = $15.51

**Key Words to Watch For:**
- **Addition**: total, sum, altogether, in all, combined
- **Subtraction**: difference, how many more, left, remain
- **Multiplication**: times, each, per, groups of
- **Division**: share, split, divide, each person gets

**Tips:**
- Draw pictures or diagrams to visualize
- Use real objects to act out the problem
- Estimate first - what's a reasonable answer?
- Read the question one more time after solving

**Fun Fact:**
The first word problems appeared in ancient Egypt about 3,700 years ago on a document called the Rhind Papyrus! One problem asked: "A quantity and its 1/7 added together become 19. What is the quantity?" People have been solving word problems for thousands of years! 📜
