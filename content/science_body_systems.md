## How Your Amazing Body Works

Your body is made up of different systems that work together to keep you alive and healthy!

**Key Facts:**
- Your body has 11 major systems
- Each system has a special job
- Systems work together (not alone)
- Taking care of your body helps all systems work better
- Your body is constantly working, even when you sleep!

**THE 11 BODY SYSTEMS:**

**1. SKELETAL SYSTEM (Bones)**

**What It Does:**
- Gives body shape and support
- Protects internal organs
- Works with muscles to help you move
- Makes blood cells
- Stores minerals (calcium)

**Key Facts:**
- 206 bones in adult body
- Babies have about 300 bones (some fuse together as you grow)
- Longest bone: femur (thighbone)
- Smallest bone: stapes in ear (size of rice grain!)
- Bones are alive and constantly changing

**Main Bones:**
- **Skull** - protects brain
- **Ribs** - protect heart and lungs
- **Spine** - 33 vertebrae, protects spinal cord
- **Pelvis** - supports upper body
- **Femur** - strongest bone

**2. MUSCULAR SYSTEM (Muscles)**

**What It Does:**
- Moves your body
- Pumps your heart
- Digests your food
- Helps you breathe

**Key Facts:**
- Over 600 muscles in body
- Three types: skeletal (voluntary), smooth (involuntary), cardiac (heart)
- Muscles work in pairs (one contracts, one relaxes)
- Strongest muscle: jaw (masseter)
- Largest muscle: gluteus maximus (buttocks)
- Most used muscle: eye muscles (move 100,000 times/day!)

**How Muscles Work:**
- Receive signals from brain
- Contract (get shorter) to pull bones
- Relax to return to normal
- Need oxygen and energy

**3. CIRCULATORY SYSTEM (Heart and Blood)**

**What It Does:**
- Pumps blood throughout body
- Delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells
- Removes waste products
- Fights infections
- Regulates body temperature

**Key Parts:**
- **Heart** - pumps blood
- **Blood vessels** - arteries, veins, capillaries
- **Blood** - carries oxygen, nutrients, waste

**Amazing Heart Facts:**
- Beats about 100,000 times per day
- Pumps 2,000 gallons of blood daily
- Size of your fist
- Has 4 chambers
- Never stops working!

**Blood:**
- **Red blood cells** - carry oxygen
- **White blood cells** - fight germs
- **Platelets** - help blood clot
- **Plasma** - liquid part
- Body has about 5 liters (1.3 gallons)

**4. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM (Breathing)**

**What It Does:**
- Brings oxygen into body
- Removes carbon dioxide
- Helps you smell
- Helps you talk

**Key Parts:**
- **Nose/Mouth** - air enters
- **Trachea** - windpipe
- **Lungs** - two organs where gas exchange happens
- **Diaphragm** - muscle that helps you breathe

**Breathing Facts:**
- Breathe about 20,000 times per day
- Each lung has about 300 million tiny air sacs (alveoli)
- Lungs could cover a tennis court if spread flat!
- Left lung smaller than right (makes room for heart)

**5. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM (Breaking Down Food)**

**What It Does:**
- Breaks food into nutrients
- Absorbs nutrients into blood
- Removes waste

**The Journey of Food:**
1. **Mouth** - chewing, saliva starts breaking down food
2. **Esophagus** - tube carrying food to stomach
3. **Stomach** - churns food, acid breaks it down (2-4 hours)
4. **Small intestine** - absorbs most nutrients (20 feet long!)
5. **Large intestine** - absorbs water, forms waste
6. **Rectum/Anus** - removes solid waste

**Digestion Facts:**
- Takes 24-72 hours to fully digest food
- Stomach makes new lining every 3-4 days
- Small intestine is actually LONGER than large intestine!
- Liver is largest internal organ (3 pounds)

**6. NERVOUS SYSTEM (Brain and Nerves)**

**What It Does:**
- Controls everything your body does
- Processes information from senses
- Thinks, remembers, feels emotions
- Sends signals throughout body

**Key Parts:**
- **Brain** - control center (100 billion nerve cells!)
- **Spinal cord** - highway of nerves
- **Nerves** - carry messages

**Brain Parts:**
- **Cerebrum** - thinking, memory, senses
- **Cerebellum** - balance, coordination
- **Brain stem** - automatic functions (breathing, heart rate)

**Nervous System Facts:**
- Signals travel at 250 mph!
- Brain uses 20% of body's energy
- Can't feel pain (no pain receptors in brain itself)
- Continues developing until age 25

**7. ENDOCRINE SYSTEM (Hormones)**

**What It Does:**
- Makes hormones (chemical messengers)
- Controls growth
- Regulates metabolism
- Manages mood and emotions

**Key Glands:**
- **Pituitary** - "master gland," controls other glands
- **Thyroid** - controls metabolism
- **Pancreas** - makes insulin (controls blood sugar)
- **Adrenal** - makes adrenaline ("fight or flight")

**8. URINARY SYSTEM (Removing Liquid Waste)**

**What It Does:**
- Filters blood
- Removes liquid waste (urine)
- Balances water and minerals

**Key Parts:**
- **Kidneys** (2) - filter blood
- **Bladder** - stores urine
- **Ureters** - tubes from kidneys to bladder
- **Urethra** - tube from bladder out of body

**Facts:**
- Kidneys filter 200 quarts of blood daily!
- Make about 1-2 quarts of urine per day
- Each kidney has 1 million tiny filters

**9. IMMUNE SYSTEM (Fighting Germs)**

**What It Does:**
- Protects against disease
- Fights infections
- Remembers germs to fight them again

**Key Parts:**
- **White blood cells** - attack invaders
- **Lymph nodes** - filter harmful substances
- **Spleen** - filters blood, stores white blood cells
- **Thymus** - makes special white blood cells

**10. INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM (Skin, Hair, Nails)**

**What It Does:**
- Protects inside of body
- Regulates temperature
- Senses touch, pain, temperature
- Makes vitamin D from sunlight

**Skin Facts:**
- Largest organ (about 20 square feet!)
- Weighs about 8 pounds
- Sheds about 30,000 dead skin cells every minute
- Three layers: epidermis, dermis, hypodermis
- Heals itself when injured

**11. REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM**

**What It Does:**
- Allows humans to make babies
- Different for males and females
- Begins working during puberty (around 10-14 years old)

**SYSTEMS WORKING TOGETHER:**

**Example: Playing Soccer**
- **Nervous System** - decides to kick ball, coordinates movement
- **Muscular & Skeletal** - legs kick, body runs
- **Respiratory** - breathes harder to get more oxygen
- **Circulatory** - pumps blood faster to muscles
- **Integumentary** - sweats to cool body down
- **Digestive** - provides energy from food eaten earlier

**Taking Care of Your Body:**

**Eat Healthy:**
- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins
- Drink lots of water

**Exercise:**
- At least 60 minutes daily
- Strengthens muscles and bones
- Good for heart and lungs
- Helps brain work better

**Sleep:**
- Kids need 9-12 hours per night
- Body repairs and grows during sleep
- Brain processes information

**Hygiene:**
- Wash hands frequently
- Brush teeth twice daily
- Bathe regularly
- Keep cuts clean

**Safety:**
- Wear helmet when biking
- Use seatbelt in car
- Wear sunscreen
- Avoid harmful substances

**Fun Fact:**
Your body is made up of about 37 trillion cells! If you lined up all the DNA from all your cells, it would stretch from Earth to the Sun and back 300 times! And every minute, your body replaces about 300 million cells. You're literally not the same person you were a month ago - most of your cells have been replaced! 🧬
