# Weather and Climate in America

## Understanding US Weather Patterns

The United States has incredibly diverse weather because it's such a big country!

**Key Facts:**
- Weather is what's happening right now (rainy, sunny, snowy)
- Climate is the typical weather pattern over many years
- The US has almost every type of climate in the world
- Weather is measured in Fahrenheit (°F) in America
- The National Weather Service tracks and predicts weather

**US Climate Zones:**

**1. Tropical (Hawaii, Southern Florida)**
- Hot and humid year-round
- Temperature: 70-90°F all year
- Hurricanes in summer/fall

**2. Dry/Desert (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico)**
- Very hot days, cool nights
- Summer: 100-110°F
- Winter: 50-70°F
- Very little rain

**3. Temperate (Most of the US)**
- Four distinct seasons
- Spring, summer, fall, winter
- Temperature range: 20-90°F throughout the year

**4. Continental (Midwest, Great Plains)**
- Hot summers, very cold winters
- Summer: 80-90°F
- Winter: 10-30°F, lots of snow

**5. Polar (Alaska)**
- Very cold most of the year
- Winter: −20 to 20°F
- Short, cool summers

**US Weather Phenomena:**

**Tornadoes:**
- Most common in "Tornado Alley" (Great Plains states)
- Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska
- Spring and early summer

**Hurricanes:**
- Hit the Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico
- Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Carolinas
- Hurricane season: June-November
- Measured by categories 1-5

**Blizzards:**
- Heavy snow and strong winds
- Common in Northeast and Midwest
- Can close schools and roads

**Thunderstorms:**
- Happen everywhere in the US
- Most common in summer
- Lightning, thunder, heavy rain

**US Weather Records:**
- **Hottest**: Death Valley, California - 134°F (July 1913)
- **Coldest**: Prospect Creek, Alaska - −80°F (January 1971)
- **Wettest**: Mount Waialeale, Hawaii - 460 inches of rain per year
- **Driest**: Death Valley, California - 2 inches of rain per year

**Weather vs. Climate:**
- **Weather**: "It's snowing today!" (short-term)
- **Climate**: "Minnesota has cold winters" (long-term pattern)

**Fun Fact:**
The United States has more tornadoes than any other country in the world - about 1,200 per year! That's because warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from Canada right over the Great Plains, creating perfect tornado conditions! 🌪️
